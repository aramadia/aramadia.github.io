										<h2>Hey there, I'm Lori!</h2>
										<p>Thanks for visiting! Here's a little about <br/ >
										who I am, what I'm doing, and where I'm going. </p>
									</header>
									<p>I work with academic and industry experts to address complex financial and economic litigation problems presented to AM Law 200 clients. I enjoy working on in-depth data analyses and economic problems, but also enjoy managing teams to solve such problems. Ultimately, I love a challenging experience and strive towards constant learning. I am currently seeking opportunities to work on product analytics and management. </p>

									<p>On a personal note, I am a San Francisco-based Canadian who is always interested in going on new hikes and hearing about new companies! I also enjoy planning corporate social events just for the heck of it, so please get in touch if you ever need an event planner! Would also like to hear from you if you would just like to chat :).</p>

									<h3>Education</h3>
									<p>Western University's business school is a two-year program that starts in one's junior year, so students are encouraged to study whatever they'd like in their freshman and sophomore years. Economics seemed applicable to the world, relevant to business, and quantitatively challenging. I think I made the right choice.</p>

												<h4>Ivey Business School</h4>

												<p>I developed a strong general business administration background at Western University's two-year business school, <a href="https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/hba/">the Ivey HBA program</a>. I took courses in <b>Financial Modelling, Decision Making with Analytics, End User Modelling, and Economics,</b> and achieved the Dean's Honor List for all semesters of the program.</p>

												<h4>Western University</h4>
												<p><i>Bachelor of Arts, Honors Global Economics </i></p>
												<p>I took a deep dive into economics and statistics during my first two years at <a href="http://economics.uwo.ca/">Western University</a>, taking courses in <b>Calculus, Econometrics, Microeconomics, and Macroeconomics</b>. I was one of two recipients in the entire class to receive the Walter J. Koenig Scholarship of Economics for academic excellence, and achieved Dean's Honor List for all semesters of the program.</p>

												<h4>Cornerstone Research</h4>

												<p>At <a href="https://www.cornerstone.com/">Cornerstone Research</a>, I support industry and academic experts in providing quantitative financial and economic analyses for clients involved in complex litigation matters.</p>
												<p>I had the exciting opportunity to work on <a href="https://www.cornerstone.com/Publications/Case-Studies/Proposed-Merger-of-Aetna-and-Humana-Enjoined"><i>United States of America, et al., v. Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc.</i></a>, a $34-billion dollar healthcare insurance merger. I built a Medicare enrollment dataset with >13M observations, and analyzed the enrollment patterns of Medicare-eligible patients using SAS and SQL. My analysis supported product market definition arguments that supported the DOJ in blocking the merger in 2017.</p>

I led a team of five entrepreneurial spirits to devise, implement, and measure marketing campaigns focused on driving website traffic. The campaigns resulted in accelerated user adoption on university campuses, and our friends picked up all sorts of random skills off the platform.</p>
